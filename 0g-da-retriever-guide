# Setting Up Your Own DA Retriever

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a DA Retriever on your machine.

## Recommended Hardware Specifications

To ensure optimal performance, it's recommended that your system meets the following hardware requirements:

- **Memory (RAM)**: 8 GB
- **Processor (CPU)**: Dual-core (2 cores)
- **Network Bandwidth**: 100 MBps for both upload and download

## Step 1: Install Required Dependencies

Before you begin, make sure to install the necessary dependencies based on your operating system.

### For Linux Users:

Start by updating your package list and installing the essential tools:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential protobuf-compiler
```

### For macOS Users:

Install the required tools using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install cmake
```

## Step 2: Install Rust

Next, you'll need to install Rust, which is essential for building the DA Retriever:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## Step 3: Clone the Source Code

Once Rust is installed, you can download the DA Retriever source code from the official repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0glabs/0g-da-retriever.git
```

## Step 4: Configuration Setup

Now that you have the source code, it's time to configure the retriever according to your needs. Here are the key fields you need to configure:

- **log_level**: Defines the verbosity of the logs.
- **grpc_listen_address**: Specifies the server's address where it will listen for incoming gRPC connections.
- **eth_rpc_endpoint**: The JSON RPC endpoint of the blockchain network you will be connecting to.

You can find and modify these settings in the `run/config.toml` file.

## Step 5: Build and Run the DA Retriever

With everything set up, it's time to build the project in release mode for optimal performance:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

After the build is complete, you can run the retriever using the following command, making sure to reference your configuration file:

```bash
./target/release/retriever --config ./run/config.toml
```

And that's it! Your DA Retriever should now be up and running, ready to interact with the blockchain network.
